## Contributing
To contribute to this project, create a branch in accordance with our branching strategy and start working on an issue. When you're done implementing, create a PR targetting the `develop` branch.

### Branching strategy
This repository uses feature branching. When working on an issue, create a branch from `develop` using the naming convention 
* `feature/#-title` for enhancements
*  `fix/#-title` for bugs.

Example: *You assign yourself to the [dummy issue #1](https://github.com/Nilsiker/rustpg/issues/1), which is labelled as an enhancement. The branch would then be named `feature/1-dummy-issue`.*

### Tips
Before creating your PR, make sure that
1. You've formatted your code using `cargo fmt --all`.
2. No errors or warnings are returned when using `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
3. All tests pass when running `cargo test`

Using [bacon](https://github.com/Canop/bacon), you can easily run `clippy` and other cargo commands in the background, while you are developing. I highly recommend you try it out!
